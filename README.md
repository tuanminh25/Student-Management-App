# UNIBEN FOOD Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my internship at **UNIBEN FOOD**. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with **Java**, working with an **H2 database**, and performing queries using Java. The output of these queries is displayed via the command line.

## Project Goals

- Integrate an **H2 database** into a Java project.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the **H2 database** using Java.
- Display query results in the **command line**.
